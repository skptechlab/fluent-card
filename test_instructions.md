## API Testing
You can test API endpoints directly:

### Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/login.php \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"TestPlayer","email":"test@example.com"}'
```

### Get Cards
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/get_cards.php
```

## Troubleshooting
- If database connection fails, game runs in offline mode
- Check PHP error logs for API issues
- Ensure all card images exist in `./cards/` directory
- For CORS issues, make sure PHP headers are set correctly
